Hype or truly useful? In this talk, I gave an overview of what it is, the first steps, and why you should or shouldn't use the much-discussed TCA. This talk was presented at the [45th CocoaTalks Campinas](https://www.meetup.com/cocoaheadscps/events/294304619/).

The talk notes are available [here](/talks/composable).
